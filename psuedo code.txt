# Step 1: Load Dataset
LOAD dataset from "1995-2024_fuel_consumption.csv" with encoding "latin-1" INTO DataFrame df

# Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
PRINT shape of df
PRINT first few rows of df
PRINT count of missing values in each column
PRINT data types of each column
PRINT summary statistics for "CO2 emissions (g/km)"
CHECK for duplicate rows in df
CHECK for negative values in relevant columns

# Step 3: Feature Selection
IDENTIFY numerical and categorical features
CALCULATE correlation matrix for numerical features
SELECT numerical features with high correlation based on threshold
PERFORM ANOVA test for categorical features against "CO2 emissions (g/km)"
SELECT categorical features with statistically significant relationship with "CO2 emissions (g/km)"

# Step 4: Outlier Detection
DETECT outliers using IQR method for numerical features
DETECT outliers using z-score method for numerical features

# Step 5: Data Visualization
PLOT box plots for numerical features before preprocessing
PLOT histograms and scatter plots for numerical features
PLOT count plots for categorical features

# Step 6: Data Preprocessing
DEFINE custom transformer for outlier handling (e.g., winsorizing or removing)
DEFINE custom transformer for ensuring non-negative values before log transformation
CREATE pipeline for numerical features (e.g., scaling, log transformation)
CREATE pipeline for categorical features (e.g., one-hot encoding)

# Step 7: Data Splitting
SPLIT data into training, validation, and test sets

# Step 8: Outlier Handling
APPLY outlier removal on training data (if applicable)

# Step 9: Data Transformation
APPLY preprocessing pipelines to training, validation, and test sets

# Step 10: Model Selection and Evaluation
DEFINE different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
TRAIN and evaluate models using pipelines
CALCULATE evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared, etc.) for validation and test sets
IDENTIFY the best model based on chosen metric (e.g., lowest RMSE on validation set)

# Step 11: Cross-Validation
PERFORM cross-validation for the best model

# Step 12: Model Diagnostics
PLOT residuals vs fitted values for the best model
PLOT learning curve for the best model
